Slicing UI Progress (50 - 60%)

All Figma Page Done

Not Done:
FrontEnd
- item_wishlist for recycleView in WishListActivity
- WishListActivity
- AboutUsActivity with the itemlist
- DetailPhoneActivity , bisa menggunakan layout ResultActivity
- NewArrivalsActivity 

FrontEnd Logic Code
DarkMode , Authentication using Firebase , 70% QuestActivity(not yet sure how many questions to use and the options due to ML team confirmation)

Minus:
- Localize not created
- Hardcoded String
- Dark mode not done still many to do (background , theme , per design have custom color to delete)
- Adding a post cannot be a fragment so it is still in ForumFragment as a layout
- There are some inconsistent item IDs and color
- Less detailed  due to design using Emulator Pixel 4 API 28
- Each PNG Image in OnBoardingActivity (MotionLayout), must have a custom xml to facilitate dynamic image localization and sizing
- Each fragment has a title on the toolbar that is not good enough
